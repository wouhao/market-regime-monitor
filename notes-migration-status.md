# Migration Status Notes

## Current State
- Frontend shows "暂无报告数据 - 数据加载失败: HTTP 404" 
- This is EXPECTED because GitHub Pages doesn't have latest.json yet
- The first report needs to be generated by GitHub Actions
- No TypeScript errors, no build errors, 91 tests passing
- Dev server running normally

## Next Steps for User
1. Configure GitHub Actions Secrets (FRED_API_KEY etc.)
2. Manually trigger first GitHub Actions workflow
3. After first report is generated, frontend will display data
